# Contents overview

The repository containts code for simulation of correlated binary data as described in [Quaqish (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/90.2.455), and fitting (i) log-link generalized estimating equations with identity variance and unknown dispersion (RR-GEE) and (ii) a penalized version (RR-PGEE), with the gradient of the Jeffreys-prior added to the estimating equations. The latter ensures finiteness of the estimates when boundary estimates occur.  

## Illustrative analysis
Our manuscript compares the two log-link GEEs through extensive simulations and the illustrative example here includes the simulation of 100 data sets from the base simulation scenario (as referred to in the manuscript).
